/ this just exists for motivation reasons lol

hovering over upload timestamps shows precise time (i.e. hovering over "5 hours ago" shows precise date and time)
added markup text (i.e. "*example* _text_" makes "example" bold and "text" italic)
if you post a comment it now shows up at the top of the comment list 
video length on video cards fades to a lower opacity when hovering so you can see thumbnails better
added github repo to related links page
comment sharing
added video and profile nominations
